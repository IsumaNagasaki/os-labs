1. With increase in fileA size the time obviously increases.
    fileA - 1M  time - 0.056s
    fileA - 2M  time - 0.074s
    fileA - 3M  time - 0.096s
The increase seems to be linear.

2. With the increase of buffer size the copy program works faster
Most probably the advance in speed will be lost when the buffer reaches the file size.
    fileA - 10K
    DBUF_SIZE = 1   time = 0.260s
    DBUF_SIZE = 2   time = 0.149s
    DBUF_SIZE = 3   time = 0.114s
    DBUF_SIZE = 4   time = 0.091s

3. With O_SYNC
    fileA - 10K
    DBUF_SIZE = 1   time = 0.238s
    DBUF_SIZE = 2   time = 0.142s
    DBUF_SIZE = 3   time = 0.113s
    DBUF_SIZE = 4   time = 0.088s

    In general it's a bit faster than without O_SYNC,
     but with increase in buffer size the difference seems to become smaller.
