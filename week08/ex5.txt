Virtual and physical addresses are independent, there is some mapping between them two 
(or can be the same sometimes). Virtual addresses refer to some virtual store, while physical 
addresses refer to hardware ones in physical memory. Size of virtual space isn't limited by 
physical addresses, it is limited only by size of virtual addresses.
